# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction and Recommendation System

A Machine Learning-based project that predicts crop yield using environmental and soil parameters and recommends the best crop for farmers to improve productivity and profit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agriculture is highly dependent on climate and soil conditions. Choosing the wrong crop may lead to poor yield and financial loss.  
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze historical agricultural data and predict crop yield. Based on the prediction, the system recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation.

The system helps farmers make data-driven decisions for smart farming.
